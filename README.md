# 增加功能，每次使用完后卸载掉checkpoint，减少显存占用

# SD Webui Memory Release
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), that calls `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after each generation.

### But Why?
- A few Reddit posts/comments mention that CUDA sometimes has memory issues, and the webui may cause memory leaks. 
This Extension *tried to* mediate that by calling `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after each generation.

### "Features"
- Turns out `postprocess` is not called when a generation fails. Thus, I added a button to manually try releasing the memory.

- Also comes with another button that unloads and reloads the checkpoint for the maximum cleanse.
    - ~~*This just calls the same functions that you can already find in the **Actions** section of the **Settings** tab*~~

- In the **System** section of the **Settings** tab, you can also turn on debug log or enable additionally refreshing the `torch` networks.
